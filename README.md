# <center> Coronavirus-themed Mobile Malware Dataset </center>

# Overview
As COVID-19 continues to spread across the world, a growing number of malicious campaigns are exploiting the pandemic. It is reported that COVID-19 is being used in a variety of online malicious activities, including Email scam, ransomware and malicious domains. As the number of the afflicted cases continue to surge, malicious campaigns that use coronavirus as a lure are increasing. Malicious developers take advantage of this opportunity to lure mobile users to download and install malicious apps.

However, besides a few media reports, the coronavirus-themed mobile malware has not been well studied. Our community lacks of the comprehensive understanding of the landscape of the coronavirus-themed mobile malware, and no accessible dataset could be used by our researchers to boost COVID-19 related cybersecurity studies.

We make efforts to create a daily growing COVID-19 related mobile app dataset. By the time of June 15, we have curated a dataset of 2,208 COVID-19 themed apps, and 315 of them are considered to be malicious. The number is growing daily and our dataset will update weekly.
